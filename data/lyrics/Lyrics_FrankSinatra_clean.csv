"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full
I traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption
I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all, and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
Oh, no, oh, no, not me
I did it my way

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

And though it's just a line to you, for me it's true, and never seemed so right before

You might forget your manners
You might refuse to stay

But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

Why should he worry when he's nice and warm

For as rich as you are, it's much better by far

Look at all you'll derive out of being alive

It lingered there, to touch your hair and walk with me
All summer long, we sang a song
And then we strolled that golden sand

Like painted kites, those days and nights they went flyin' by
The world was new, beneath a blue umbrella sky
Then softer than, a piper man, one day it called to you
I lost you, I lost you to the summer wind

They have come and gone
And still the days, those lonely days they go on and on

You would laugh to beat the band
Look at yourself, do you still believe the rumor
That romance is simply grand?
Since you took it right on the chin
You have lost that bright toothpaste grin

Fools rush in, so here I am
Very glad to be unhappy
I can't win, but here I am
More than glad to be unhappy
Unrequited love's a bore

"It's not that easy bein' green
Having to spend each day the color of the leaves
When I think it could be nicer bein' red or yellow or gold
Or something much more colourful like that

It's not easy bein' green
It seems you blend in with so many other ordinary things
And people tend to pass you over 'cause you're
Not standin' out like flashy sparkles on the water
Or stars in the sky

But green is the colour of spring
And green can be cool and friendly-like

And green can be big like an ocean
Or important like a mountain
Or tall like a tree
When green is all there is to be
It could make you wonder why
But why wonder, why wonder?
I am green and it'll do fine
It's beautiful
And I think it's what I want to be

"I know I said that I was leaving

To walk away from someone
Who means everything in life to you

Ive learned and Ive come back to stay

Let me try again
Think of all we had before
Let me try once more
We can have it all
You and I again
Just forgive me
Or ill die
Please let me try again
I was such a fool to doubt you
To try and go it all alone
There's no sense to life without you
Now all i do is just exist
And think about the chance ive missed
To beg is not an easy task
But pride is such a foolish mask

A mule is an animal with long funny ears
Kicks up at anything he hears
His back is brawny and his brain is weak

Or would you like to swing on a star

Or would you rather be a fish?
A fish won't do anything, but swim in a brook
He can't write his name or read a book
And to fool the people is his only thought
And though he's slippery, he still gets caught
But then if that sort of life is what you wish

But we didn't stop for tea
How cozy it was
Now since our breakup I wake up
Alone on a gray morning-after
I long for the sound of your laughter
And then I see the laugh's on me
But thanks for the memory
Of every touch a thrill
I've been through the mill
I've lived a lot and learned a lot
You loved me not and still
I miss you so much
Thanks for the memory
Of how we used to jog
Even in a fog
That barbecue in malibu
Away from all the smog
How rainy it was
Thanks for the memory
Of letters I destroyed
Books that we enjoyed
Tonight the way things look
I need a book by sigmund freud
How brainy he was
Gone are those evenings on broadway
Together we'd go to a great show
But now I begin with the late show
And wish that you
Were watching, too
I know it's a fallacy
That grown men never cry
Baby, that's a lie
We had our bed of roses
But forgot that roses die
And thank you so much",,,Thanks for the Memory by Frank Sinatra,False,https://images.genius.com/2c8ab9e91adc8a26346466b9e48b2dab.300x300x1.jpg,https://images.genius.com/2c8ab9e91adc8a26346466b9e48b2dab.500x500x1.jpg,complete,https://images.genius.com/2c8ab9e91adc8a26346466b9e48b2dab.300x300x1.jpg,https://images.genius.com/2c8ab9e91adc8a26346466b9e48b2dab.500x500x1.jpg,Thanks for the Memory,Thanks for the Memory,[],Frank Sinatra,824

You can't get cherry soda'Cause they've got to fill that quota
And the way things are I'll bet they never will
They've got a zillion tons of coffee in Brazil
No tea or tomato juice
You'll see no potato juice
The planters down in Santos all say no no no
The politician's daughter
Was accused of drinking water
And was fined a great big fifty dollar bill
They've got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil
You date a girl and find out laterShe smells just like a percolator
Her perfume was made right on the grill
Why they could percolate the ocean in Brazil
And when their ham and eggs need savor
Coffee ketchup gives 'em flavor
Coffee pickles way outsell the dill
Why they put coffee in the coffee in Brazil
So your lead to the local color
Serving coffee with a cruller
Dunking doesn't take a lot of skill

"Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real, so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that seems so bright?
Ages ago last night

To think that spring had depended
On merely this: a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

So now let's reminisce
And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung
When we were young last night",1955-04-25,"April 25, 1955",Last Night When We Were Young by Frank Sinatra,True,https://images.genius.com/6356f3fe5b881c47749632feb208fdcb.300x300x1.jpg,https://images.genius.com/6356f3fe5b881c47749632feb208fdcb.905x905x1.jpg,complete,https://images.genius.com/6356f3fe5b881c47749632feb208fdcb.300x300x1.jpg,https://images.genius.com/6356f3fe5b881c47749632feb208fdcb.905x905x1.jpg,Last Night When We Were Young,Last Night When We Were Young,[],Frank Sinatra,824

Verse:
The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame
There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love and you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it
Chorus:
Holding hands at midnight
'Neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
It's nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?",,,Nice Work If You Can Get It by Frank Sinatra,False,https://images.genius.com/4d65f97980c2ef96c62091d63251c0c6.300x300x1.jpg,https://images.genius.com/4d65f97980c2ef96c62091d63251c0c6.640x640x1.jpg,complete,https://images.genius.com/4d65f97980c2ef96c62091d63251c0c6.300x300x1.jpg,https://images.genius.com/4d65f97980c2ef96c62091d63251c0c6.640x640x1.jpg,Nice Work If You Can Get It,Nice Work If You Can Get It,[],Frank Sinatra,824

Because this weakness is a sad condition that affects guys all over the world?

That he sacrifices everything and moves all the way to Malacksy

You can bet they'll be minting it for some doll

And he smells from Vitalis and Barbasol

"It isn't by chance I happen to be
A boulevardier, the toast of Paris
For over the noise, the talk and the smoke
I'm good for a laugh, a drink or a joke
I walk in a room, a party or ball
""Come sit over here"" somebody will call
""A drink for M'sieur, a drink for us all!
But how many times I stop and recall
Ah, the apple trees
Blossoms in the breeze
That we walked among
Lying in the hay
Games we used to play
While the rounds were sung
Only yesterday, when the world was young
Wherever I go they mention my name
And that in itself, is some sort of fame
""Come by for a drink, we're having a game,""
Wherever I go I'm glad that I came
The talk is quite gay, the company fine
There's laughter and lights, and glamour and wine
And beautiful girls and some of them mine
But often my eyes see a diff'rent shine
Ah, the apple trees
Sunlit memories
Where the hammock swung
On our backs we'd lie
Looking at the sky
Till the stars were strung
Only last July when the world was young
Ah, the apple trees
Blossoms in the breeze
That we walked among
Lying in the hay
Games we used to play
While the rounds were sung
Only yesterday, when the world was young
While sitting around, we often recall
The laugh of the year, the night of them all
The blonde who was so attractive that year
Some opening night that made us all cheer

And order orange juice for one

All indiscreet hearts
Seemed romantic fools

Was my heart's domain
I saw your eyes
Now castles rise in Spain!
I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stood still
My feet could step and walk
My lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still
Though not a single word was spoken
I could tell you knew
That unfelt clasp of hands
Told me so well you knew
I never lived at all
Until the thrill of that moment when
My heart stood still

I guess he'll call me the ""old man""

And his feet planted firm on the ground
And you won't see nobody dare to try
To boss or toss him around!
No pot-bellied, baggy-eyed bully'll toss him around
I don't give a damn what he does
As long as he does what he likes!
He can sit on his tail
Or work on a rail
With a hammer, hammering spikes!
He can ferry a boat on a river
Or peddle a pack on his back
Or work up and down
The streets of a town
With a whip and a horse and a hack
He can haul a scow along a canal
Run a cow around a corral
Or maybe bark for a carousel
Of course it takes talent to do that well
He might be a champ of theheavyweights
Or a feller that sells you glue
Or President of the United States

But he wouldn't be President unless he wanted to be

Him around
And I'll be damned if he'll marry the boss' daughter
A skinny-lipped virgin with blood like water
Who'll give him a peck
And call it a kiss
And look in his eyes through a lorgnet

And startin' to go with a girl

What if he is a girl?

Is half again as bright
As girls are meant to be!

Many a likely lad does what he can to woo her

Gets hungry ev'ry night and she come home to me!

I got to make certain that she
Won't be dragged up in slums
With a lot o' bums like me
She's got to be sheltered
And be dressed in the best money can buy!

"It came upon the midnight clear, that glorious song of old
From angels bending near the earth to touch their harps of gold
Peace on the earth, goodwill to men, from heav'n's all gracious king
The world in solemn stillness lay to hear the angels sing
Still through the cloven skies they come with peaceful wings unfurl
And still their heavenly music floats, O'er all the weary world
Above its sad and lowly plains they bend on hovering wing
And ever o'er its Babel sounds the blessed angels sing
O ye, beneath life's crushing load, whose forms are bending low
Who toil along the climbing way with painful steps and slow
Look now for glad and golden hours come swiftly on the wing
O rest beside the weary road and hear the angels sing
For lo the days are hastening on, by prophets seen of old

Was it dusty on the train, P. S. I love you

They came around to call, and I burned a hole in the dining room table
And let me see, I guess that's all
Nothing else for me to say, and so I'll close but by the way

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away

The lonely night dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
Now my consolation
Is in the stardust of a song
Beside a garden wall
When stars are bright
You are in my arms

"INTRO:
In the hustle of the day, we're all inclined to miss
Little things that mean so much
A word, a smile, and a kiss
When a woman loves a man, he's a hero in her eyes
And a hero he can always be if he'll just realize
She may be weary, women do get weary
Wearing the same shabby dress
And when she's weary, try a little tenderness
She may be waiting, just anticipating
Things she may never possess
While she's without them, try a little tenderness
It's not just sentimental, she has her grief and her care
But a word that's soft and gentle makes it easier to bear
You won't regret it, women don't forget it
Love is their whole happiness
And it's all so easy, try a little tenderness",1946-03-04,"March 4, 1946",Try A Little Tenderness by Frank Sinatra,False,https://images.genius.com/cbaf709271294e770e0d07840996eff0.300x300x1.jpg,https://images.genius.com/cbaf709271294e770e0d07840996eff0.1000x1000x1.jpg,complete,https://images.genius.com/cbaf709271294e770e0d07840996eff0.300x300x1.jpg,https://images.genius.com/cbaf709271294e770e0d07840996eff0.1000x1000x1.jpg,Try A Little Tenderness,Try A Little Tenderness,[],Frank Sinatra,824

Has brought my lover to me

One that they could croon

So they started swaying to and fro

Singing weird melodies
And they made that the start of the blues
And from a jail came the wail
Of a down-hearted frail
And they played that
As part of the blues
From a whippoorwill

They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn

Baby, it's cold out there
This evening has been
Been hoping
That you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands
They're just like ice
My mother
Will start to worry
Beautiful
What you're hurry
And father
Will be
Pacing the floor
Listen
To that fireplace
Roar
So really
I'd better scurry
Beautiful
Please don't hurry
Well, maybe
Just a half
A drink more
Put some records on
While i pour
And the neighbors
Might think
Baby
It's bad out there
Say
What's in this drink?
No cabs
To be had out there
I wish i knew how
Your eyes
Are like starlight now
To break the spell
I'll take your hat
Your hair looks swell
I ought to say
No, no, no sir
Mind if i
Mmove in closer?
At least i'm gonna say
That i tried
What's the sense of
Hurtin' my pride?
I really can't stay
Baby don't hold out
Baby
But it's cold outside
I simply must go
But baby
It's cold outside
The answer is no
I say
It's cold out there
The welcome
Has been how lucky
That you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out that window
Man that's hard
My sister
Will be suspicious
Gosh
Your lips look delicious
My brother
Will be there at the door
Waves upon a tropical
Shore
My maiden
Aunt's mind is vicious
Gosh
Your lips are delicious
Well maybe
Just a cigarette more
Oh
Never such a blizzard
Before
I've got to go home
Baby
You'll freeze out there
Say, lend me your coat
It's up
To your knees out there
You've really been grand
I thrill
When you touch my hand
But don't you see
How can you do
This thing to me
There's bound
To be talk tomorrow
Think
Of my lifelong sorrow
At least there
Will be plenty implied
If you caught pneumonia
And died
I really can't stay
Get over that old lie

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in they dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight
For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth
How silently, how silently, the wondrous gift is given
So God imparts to human hearts the blessings of his heaven
No ear may hear his coming, but in this world of sin
Where meek souls will receive him still, the dear Christ enters in

Cast out our sin and enter in, be born in us today

A lucky star's above - but not for me

Than any Russian play - can guarantee
I was a fool to fall - and get this way
Ah ho alas and awe - so lackaday
Although I can't dismiss
The memory of her kiss
I guess she's not - she's not for me
Old man sunshine - listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it - and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me she will care
I'm certain - it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Polly-Anna's
Who tell you fate supplies a mate - it's all bananas

"Spoken:
A tune from Cole Porter perhaps. Now there's a guy who writes for keeps. His tunes not only become hits, they stay hits. Begin the Beguine was written in 1935, and it's still very popular
When they begin the beguine, it brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor, it brings back a memory ever green
I'm with you once more under the stars, and down by the shore an orchestra's playing
Even the palms seem to be swaying, when they begin the beguine
To live it again is past all endeavor, except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever, and promising never, never to part
What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds come along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean
So don't let them begin the beguine, let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember when they begin the beguine
Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, Darling, I love you!

The streets were covered with a film of ice
But a little simple magic that I learned about somewhere
Changed the weather all around, just within a thrice

I bought you violets for your furs and there was April in that December
The snow drifted down and the flowers, and that is where it lay
The snow looked like dew and the blossoms as on a summer day
I bought you violets for your furs and there was blue in the wintry sky

"I reached the age of forty somewhat sooner than expected
Living at a fairly hectic pace
When I count the years that I have happily collected
The future shows its apprehensive face
(But now, Francis, what the hell do you do now, Francis?)
Quite a different song must be sung
When the singer is no longer young
Before the music ends, before it fades away
There are several very necessary things I must do
Friends I must see again, certain places
Where I must be again
Before the music ends
I must go to Hoboken one more time
I wanna run down that street where that thin Italian kid ran
Then slow down at the school
Where those nice old ladies tried to teach me
Unaware that I knew much more than they did
And stop at the poolroom for a beer
And sadly say to myself, I don't know anybody here
(Francis, don't go home again.)
One thing I'd like to do
Before the music ends
Is to thank some wonderful life-long friends
I've never met but have known so well
From one Frank to another, thank you for your dream
Your dream is now my own
And thank you Ludwig Van
For the flights of fancy you sent me on
Thank Mrs. Verdi, for Joe and a special thanks to Giacomo
All of you took turns in delivering sunrise a little sooner to my window
Before the music ends, with company by Dino and Sarge
I'd like to make one more charge at Vegas
You won't find me at that idiot wheel that spins, and spins and spins
I won't play the slot machine
The management always wins
Not for me the game where the Jack is called Black:
Hand me them dice and stand back!
(Put five hundred on the line
And a hundred on the come
If Sinatra makes his Nine, blow the trumpets, beat the drum!)
You won't hear me talk about baby‘s new shoes, baby's got 57 pairs...
All I ask is a Nine, just a plain and simple Nine
(just a little five and four, just a little six and three
Nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine)
Nine!!! 

In years to come, I may forget if I lost or if I won
But I'll always remember how much fun it was
(just a little five and four, just a little six and three)
And when the music ends
I'd like it to end this way
I'll ask Chester to write me one more song
I'll get Lefty to make me one more chart
And I'll make one more record with the best musicians in the world
And when that cat with the scythe
Comes tugging at my sleeve
I'll be singing as I leave

To keep my mind off other things
So, ladies, let your fingers dance
And keep your hands out of romance
Lovely es
Let the stitches
Keep your fingers under control
Cut the thread, but leave
The whole heart whole
Merry maids can sew and sleep
Wives can only sew and weep

Is falling for make-believe

Is playing the fool
Caring too much is juvenile fancy
Learning to trust is just

I've seen the look - of a jockey on a winner

The gentlest breeze
It's friendly, it's frightening
And more surprising than an elephant's sneeze
I've seen the look - every single blushing bride has
I've seen the look - that the fellow by her side has
But there's one look - that I'd give my life to see

And if you could speak, what a fascinating tale you would tell
Of an age the world has long forgotten
Of an age that weaves a silent magic in Granada today
The dawn in the sky greets the day with a sigh for Granada
For she can remember the splendor that once was Granada
It still can be found in the hills all around as I wander along
Entranced by the beauty before me
Entranced by a land full of flowers and song
When day is done and the sun starts to set in Granada
I envy the blush of the snow-clad Sierra Nevada
Soon it will welcome the stars
While a thousand guitars play a soft cabanera
Then moonlit Granada will live again
The glory of yesterday, romantic and gay

Hello young lovers who ever you are
I hope your troubles are few
All my good wishes go with you tonight
I've been in love like you
Be brave young lovers and follow your star
Be brave and faithful and true
Cling very close to each other tonight
I've been in love like you
I know how it feels to have wings on your heels
And fly down the street in a trance
You fly down a street on a chance that you'll meet
And you meet not really by chance
Don't cry young lovers what ever you do
Don't cry because I'm alone

But people from Missouri never incensed me

How many, many times the worm had turned
They all laughed at Christopher Columbus
When he said the world was round
They all laughed when Edison recorded sound
They all laughed at Wilbur and his brother
When they said that man could fly
They told Marconi
Wireless was a phony
It's the same old cry
They laughed at me wanting you
Said I was reaching for the moon

Now they're fighting to get in

They all laughed Fulton and his steamboat
Hershey and his chocolate bar

They laughed at me wanting you
Said it would be, ""Hello, Goodbye.""

"I cried the day you left me and I still don't know what kept me
From jumping off the highest bridge I know
My poor heart was breaking, I felt lower than a snake-in
That is just about the lowest you can go
I finally stopped my drinking, fell down and started thinking
That it's no pay to relive yesterday
I tried to hide my sorrow, started living for tomorrow
I think I'm gonna make it all the way
You hurt me and abused me, took advantage of and used me
I swear it almost made a wreck of me
When I needed your devotion, you were never in the notion
You were cold as any iceberg in the sea
Love to you had lost its splendor, my pride went out the window
When you left me, I kept begging you to stay
But now my heart is healing, and I got a real good feeling
I think I'm gonna make it all the way
My troubles came in bunches, I kept rolling with the punches
You'd shoot me down and I'd get back again
I tried to be your lover, in no time I did discover
Your loving cup was not for me to win
Your kisses weren't the same but I kept kinda fan the flame
Till I just couldn't take another day
You can't blame me for trying, now I stopped my crying
I think I'm gonna make it all the way
I tried my best to take it, but my smiling face didn't make it
'Cause in my heart, I knew there was no hope
Each place reminded me of the memories of your love
I've come right to the end of my rope
That's when I met my new friend, she's just as much a true friend
Treats me like a lover here to stay
And it's working out so well now, you can go to hell now

"Dream away, child; let your dreams run wild
Or a lifetime of worries might claim you
Dream away, child; let your dreams run wild
Or the years and the tears shed might claim you
For the last time we have tasted
Love's sweet tears by the fire's glow
If our hearts are strong there'll be
No long good-byes when it's time to go
But the strongest torch is sometimes broken
As the deepest vows aren't always spoken
And the greatest wounds, we hide inside ourselves
Where they never show
Dream away, child, let your dreams run wild
Or a lifetime of worries might claim you
Dream away, child; let your dreams run wild
Or the years and the tears shed might claim you
When the Winter weds the Northern Wind
The child they bear is snow
And the branches bow like worried bridesmaids
But the trees will grow
Sun and Earth in time will come together
God will give us back our summer weather
But the mem'ries of that first sweet
Taste of love pass away so slow
Dream away, child; let your dreams run wild
Or a lifetime of worries might claim you
Dream away, child; let your dreams run wild

"When I try to sing you say I'm off key
Why can't you see how much this hurts me
With your perfect beauty and your perfect pitch
You're a perfect terror
When I come around, must you always put me down
If you say my singing is off key my love
You will hurt my feelings don't you see my love
I wish I had an ear like yours
A voice that would behave
But all I have is feelings and a voice gone deaf
You insist my music goes against the rules
But rules were never made for lovesick fools
I wrote this little song for you but you don't care
It's a crooked song oh but all my love is there
The thing that you would see if you would play your part
Is even if I'm out of tune I have a gentle heart
I took your picture with my trusty Rollaflex
And now all I have developed is a complex
Possibly in vain I hope you weaken oh my love
And forget these rigid rules that undermine my dream of
A life of love and music with someone who'll understand
That even though I may be out of tune
When I attempt to say how much I love you
All that matters is the message that I bring
Which is my dear one I love you",,,Desafinado by Frank Sinatra,False,https://images.genius.com/5f746dbf6c41747811e11452bfabb552.300x300x1.jpg,https://images.genius.com/5f746dbf6c41747811e11452bfabb552.490x490x1.jpg,complete,https://images.genius.com/5f746dbf6c41747811e11452bfabb552.300x300x1.jpg,https://images.genius.com/5f746dbf6c41747811e11452bfabb552.490x490x1.jpg,Desafinado,Desafinado,[],Frank Sinatra,824

"One afternoon I came to hear
You sing a soft song into my ear
Who would have thought quite by chance
We might engage in a loving dance?
Coming together, coming apart
Lost in diversions, dancing stars
Caught in the quiet, off on our own
Coming together, standing alone
Are you afraid?
I'm not afraid
What about you, what about me?
Two years from now where will we be?
Each of us gone our separate ways
Lost in a headlong passage of days
Maybe we might give love a try
Extending the moment before ""goodbye""
And for a gentle moment in time
We'll take what pleasure people can find
Are you afraid?
I'm not afraid
What is for real, what is false?
All of us seem to be caught in a waltz
Turning around, turning again
When will the dancing ever end?
As for us, you and me
Our eyes are open, we can see
Both of us know where we've been
Why must we both go dancing again?
Come join the dancing, come join the waltz
Don't look too closely at my faults
Why can't I die here in your arms?
Safe from the night and safe from the dawn
Back to the nowhere from where I came
Don't worry of me, I know what I am
Where I'm goin' and where I've been

I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see;
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon;
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes
You and you glance;
Make this romance;
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night;
Blazing their light;
Can't hold a candle;
To your razzle-dazzle
You've got me flyin' high and wide;
On a magic carpet ride;
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon

The summer smiles, the summer knows, and unashamed, she sheds her clothes
The summer smoothes the restless sky
And lovingly she warms the sand on which you lie
The summer knows, the summer's wise, she sees the doubts within your eyes
And so she takes her summertime, tells the moon to wait and the sun to linger
Twist the world around her summer finger

I should be crying, it ought to hurt a little more

With that fact in mind, my tears were never apropos
Hey. look, no sorrow, I have been luckier than most
And if tomorrow I still feel haunted by her ghost

"When I take you out tonight with me
Honey, here's the way it's gonna be
You will sit behind a team of snow-white horses in the slickest gig you'll ever see
Chicks and ducks and geese better scurry
When I take you out in the surrey
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top
Watch that fringe and see how it flutters
When I drive them high steppin' strutters
Nosy folks will peep through the shutters and their eyes will pop
Those wheels are yellow, the upholstery's brown, the dashboard's genuine leather
With nice bright curtains that can roll right down in case there's a change in the weather
Two bright side lights winking and blinkin
Ain't no finer rig I'm a-thinking
You can keep your rig if you're thinking that I care to swap
For that shiny little surrey with the fringe on the top
(Would you say the fringe was made of silk?) Wouldn't have no other kind but silk
(Has it really got a team of snow-white horses?)
One's like snow, the others more like milk (so you can tell `em apart)
All the world would fly in a flurry
When I take you out in the surrey
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top
When we hit that road hell for leather
Cats and dogs all dance in the heather
Birds and frogs will sing all together and the toads will hop
The wind will whistle as we rattle along, the cows will moo in the clover
The river will ripple out a whispered song, and whisper it over and over

Has withered away
Where you planted roses
The weeds seem to say

I see your face

There's empty space

Leave your heart a shambles, never give an inch

Moment of desire or it's go-for-broke
But however it's planned, when it's close as your hand

You may be the one in a million
Who's lucky to win that prize
You may be the one in a million
Who gets it between the eyes

Soothing as a lotion or a constant pain
You won't know what you've got till your heart's on a spot
Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance
Love may be a double or a base on balls
Tiny water buffalo on Niagara Falls
Though the cards in the game never turn up the same
Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance
Love may be a Grable or a two-ton truck
Regal as a sable or a Donald Duck
But you mustn't avoid what's as basic as Freud
Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance
Love is real devotion or it's inhumane
Still without emotion or a hurricane

Bend your knees and bow your head
And pull that rope until you're dead

And all because of the gal that got away
No more her eager call

They have all gone astray

She's run off and undone you

Has seen its final inning

It's all a crazy game
No more - no more that all time thrill
Because you have been put though the mill
And never a new love
Will ever be the same
Good riddance good-bye
Every trick of hers you are on to
But fools will be fools
And where's she gone? - Where has she gone?

It's lonelier and it's tougher
With hope you burn up
Tomorrow maybe she'll turn up
There ain't no let up

I don't have to follow them to know how far they'll go
I've been there
If the boy is sulking and the girl is close to tears
I know it doesn't matter, who is right or who started the fight
I've been there

Young songs, good songs, bad songs, sweet songs, sad songs
I've been there when a pretty smile made it difficult to breathe
But so easy to fly and a pleasure to cry
So to all of you in the throes of early love
Where delightful confusion reigns supreme

I got it bad and that ain't good

Doesn't love me like I love her, no, nobody could

As I approach the prime of my life
I find I have the time of my life
Learning to enjoy at my leasure
All the simple pleasure
And so I happily concede
This is all I ask
This is all I need
Beautiful girl, walk a little slower when you walk by me
Lingering sunset, stay a little longer with the lonely sea
Children everywhere, when you shoot at bad men, shoot at me
Take me to that strange enchanted land
Grownups seldom understand
Wandering rainbows, leave a bit of color for my heart to own
Stars in the sky, make my wish come true
Before the night has flown
And let the music play as long as there's a song to sing
Then I will stay younger than spring",,,This Is All I Ask by Frank Sinatra,False,https://images.genius.com/0cb07186da41587636f667c4f2275047.300x300x1.jpg,https://images.genius.com/0cb07186da41587636f667c4f2275047.500x500x1.jpg,complete,https://images.genius.com/0cb07186da41587636f667c4f2275047.300x300x1.jpg,https://images.genius.com/0cb07186da41587636f667c4f2275047.500x500x1.jpg,This Is All I Ask,This Is All I Ask,[],Frank Sinatra,824

Because it does what you want it to do
It has a passion, the Continental
An invitation to moonlight and romance
It's quite the fashion, the Continental
Because you tell of your love while you dance
You kiss while you're dancing
It's continental, ooh, it's continental
You sing while you're dancing
Your voice is gentle and so sentimental
You'll know before the dance is through
That you're in love with her and she's in love with you
You'll find while you're dancin'
That there's a rhythm in your heart and soul
A certain rhythm that you can't control
And you will do the Continental all the time
You'll find while you're dancin'
That there's a rhythm in your heart and soul
A certain rhythm that you can't control
And you will do the Continental all the time
Beautiful music
Dangerous rhythm

All grown up with freckles on your face
We'd spend each night with company
Just you the teddy bears the dolls and me
What a funny girl you used to be

Getting all involved with something new
Always some new recipe
The kitchen always looked like world war three
What a funny girl you used to be
It was so good with you around
You always found a smile
Where smiles could not be found
I never ever met a person more sincere
You'd always listen
With an open ear

One little heartache left as a token
One little plaything carelessly broken

Remember?
Remember you vowed
By all the stars above you
Remember?
Remember we found a lonely spot
And after I learned to care a lot
You promised that you'd forget me not

To remember

(For there you will see that you will pray for light)
(The future will almost certainly be whatever you want it to be,)
(But with rockets and picks, from music and jetsam)
(There's no butt that you can push, and push,)
(Let your imagination burst into flame)
(And it will let you do whatever you damn well to do, do,do)

To draw a melody, from that enchanted blade of grass
And cheese and wood and wind and sea

Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven
Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those who trespass against us
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil
For yours is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory forever

It wings beggars and kings

Once again your face comes back to me

And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye;
But you remained in my heart
So tell me darling is there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame, we knew
Should I go on whisteling in the dark?

And his bright green tie

He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet

You tried to sing, but couldn't squeak
In fact you loved him so you couldn't even speak

And there it will always be, there where I can hear the Song of the Sabia
I'll go back, I know now that I'll go back, I will lie in the shadow of
A palm that's no longer there, and pick a flower that doesn't grow
And maybe someone's love will speak the night
The lonely unwanted light that may bring me through the new day
I'll go back, I know now that I'll go back, they won't be in vain
All the plans I made to deceive myself, all the rose I made just to lose myself
All the love I made to forget myself, those mistakes I made just to find myself

Waking up one day and finding somewhere to run, somewhere to run
Somewhere to run when your world's come undone

It says: ""pass this affair and pass it wide""
You may be a puzzle, but I like the way the parts fit
Still that little voice says: ""Go get your track shoes -put them on and get""

And find us romance

Your style and your stance
There's only one problem - the tiniest problem

I might take a (the) chance
And though you're the charmer - who could bend my armor

I like to steer the car - whenever I drive
And hold the door ajar - when we arrive
So if it's decided - that this is romance

Than we ever cared to know
But we came to find the secret
And we never let it go
And it was more than being holy
Though it was less than being free

He kicks up at anything he hears
His back is brawny - and his brain is weak
He's just plain stupid with a - stubborn streak

You may grow up to be a mule

Or would you rather be a fish
A fish won't do anything but swim in a brook

And to fool the people is his only thought
Though he slippery - he still gets caught
But then if that sort of life is what you wish
You may grow up to be a fish

"That's life, that's what people say
You're riding high in April
Shot down in May
But I know I'm gonna change that tune
When I'm back on top, back on top in June
I said, that's life, and as funny as it may seem
Some people get their kicks
Stompin' on a dream
But I don't let it, let it get me down
'Cause this fine old world it keeps spinnin' around
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate
A poet, a pawn and a king
I've been up and down and over and out
And I know one thing:
Each time I find myself flat on my face
I pick myself up and get back in the race
That's life, I tell ya, I can't deny it
I thought of quitting, baby
But my heart just ain't gonna buy it
And if I didn't think it was worth one single try
I'd jump right on a big bird and then I'd fly
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate
A poet, a pawn and a king

Many times I thought of cuttin' out but my heart won't buy it

I keep looking at the rain-swept sky
In this small apartment where she used to love me
I just sit here as my life goes by
There's no doorbell ringing, no sweet sounds of singing
Just a silent room where tears won't dry
Life is sad when people hurt you, sad when friends desert you
Sad when dreams get lost beyond recall
But remembering that love stopped blossoming
And that's the saddest thing of all

Of thrills and laughter, only lovers know
She was proud of me and we were young and free
One touch was all it took, and off we go
Now above the rain, I hear a passing plane
And all my loneliness begins to show

"And now the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full
I've travelled each and every highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way
Regrets, I've had a few
But then again too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption
I planned each chartered course
Each careful step along the by-way
And more, much more than this
I did it my way
Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all
And I stood tall
And did it my way
I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
Oh, no, no not me
I did it my way
For what is a man, what has he got
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way
Yes, it was my way",,,My way - live at royal albert hall / 1984 by Frank Sinatra,False,https://images.genius.com/5f746dbf6c41747811e11452bfabb552.300x300x1.jpg,https://images.genius.com/5f746dbf6c41747811e11452bfabb552.490x490x1.jpg,complete,https://images.genius.com/5f746dbf6c41747811e11452bfabb552.300x300x1.jpg,https://images.genius.com/5f746dbf6c41747811e11452bfabb552.490x490x1.jpg,My way - live at royal albert hall / 1984,My way - live at royal albert hall / 1984,[],Frank Sinatra,824

I'll take the same old stroll we took through the park
And I'll cling to you, dear, just as though you were here

Each night before I wander off into sleep
I'll bring to light the tears I've buried so deep
Then I'll kiss you, my dear, just as though you were here

"Spoken:
Wherever we may be along about this time of year, our hearts become sentimental pilgrims and head for home. Because home is where we all discover that Christmas is one time of the year when we don't have to be wealthy to be rich. Some of us remember Christmas as the time when Dad gave us our first gold watch. Others remember it as the time when a charity organization delivered a Christmas basket to the doorstep before dawn, so the neighbors wouldn't see and Mother wouldn't be embarrassed. But whether the hearth that cheered your family was a fireplace of marble or a kitchen stove of cast iron, you'll remember that your home was the richest place on earth, warmed by the richest spirit on earth, the spirit of Christmas. And that's why I've chosen this next song to sing as a Christmas song. It's not a carol, it's just a beautiful pathway of friendly and understanding music up which our hearts may travel as they make their Yuletide pilgrimage goin' home
Goin' home, goin' home
I'm a'goin' home
Quiet-like, some still day
I'm a'goin' home
It's not far, just close by
Through an open door
Work all done, care laid by
Goin'ta fear no more
Mother's there, 'spectin' me
Father's waitin', too
Lots of folks gathered there
All the friends I knew
Spoken:
One of the most precious gifts we have throughout the year is one we often forget, the precious gift of freedom. Freedom to work, to play, to worship as we please. Freedom to decided how we'll handle our own future, 'cause we can make our future and that of our families a secure one though saving. We can buy Savings Bonds to take care of that new home or an education for our kids. No one says we hafta buy 'em, we wanna buy 'em, 'cause they're not only an investment in our own future, they're an investment in the finest country in the world. So let me urge you sincerely, as we look toward a new year, to plan for making it a secure year, for the regular purchase of US Savings Bonds.

"Spoken:
A tune from Cole Porter perhaps. Now there's a guy who writes for keeps. His tunes not only become hits, they stay hits. Begin the Beguine was written in 1935, and it's still very popular
When they begin the beguine, it brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor, it brings back a memory ever green
I'm with you once more under the stars, and down by the shore an orchestra's playing
Even the palms seem to be swaying, when they begin the beguine
To live it again is past all endeavor, except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever, and promising never, never to part
What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds come along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean
So don't let them begin the beguine, let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember when they begin the beguine
Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, Darling, I love you!
And we suddenly know what heaven we're in, when they begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",,,Begin the Beguine (2) by Frank Sinatra,False,https://images.genius.com/5f746dbf6c41747811e11452bfabb552.300x300x1.jpg,https://images.genius.com/5f746dbf6c41747811e11452bfabb552.490x490x1.jpg,complete,https://images.genius.com/5f746dbf6c41747811e11452bfabb552.300x300x1.jpg,https://images.genius.com/5f746dbf6c41747811e11452bfabb552.490x490x1.jpg,Begin the Beguine (2),Begin the Beguine (2),[],Frank Sinatra,824

Verse:
The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame
There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love and you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it
Chorus:
Holding hands at midnight
'Neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
It's nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?",,,Nice Work If You Can Get It - Count Basie Orchestra by Frank Sinatra,False,https://images.genius.com/5f746dbf6c41747811e11452bfabb552.300x300x1.jpg,https://images.genius.com/5f746dbf6c41747811e11452bfabb552.490x490x1.jpg,complete,https://images.genius.com/5f746dbf6c41747811e11452bfabb552.300x300x1.jpg,https://images.genius.com/5f746dbf6c41747811e11452bfabb552.490x490x1.jpg,Nice Work If You Can Get It - Count Basie Orchestra,Nice Work If You Can Get It - Count Basie Orchestra,[],Frank Sinatra,824

Why despair at the fair possibility luck has flown
Stick around, fend your ground, till the cards are shown

Born to give them second birth

"I've got you under my skin
I have got you deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart that you’re really a part of me
I've got you under my skin
I have tried so not to give in
And I said to myself this affair it never will go so well
But why should I try to resist when baby I know so well
That I've got you under my skin
I’d sacrifice anything, come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice, comes in the night
It repeats - repeats in my ear
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win
Use your mentality - wake up to reality
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin
(Run for cover - run and hide!)
I would sacrifice anything, come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice, comes in the night
It repeats, how it yells in my ear
Don't you know, you fool, there ain't no chance to win
Why not use your mentality - wake up-step up to reality

"In the sleepy town of San Juanita
There's a story that the padre tells
Of a gay senor and senorita
And the serenade of the bells
Seems they asked the padre for permission
To be married early in the spring
But their folks had just made one condition
That the mission bells had to ring
Everyone knew that the bells were broken
And hadn't sounded for a long long time
Then one night the village was astounded
For the bells began to chime
Still the bells are broken, goes the story
But if in your heart a true love dwells
They will chime for you in all it's glory

I guess he'll call me the ""old man""
I guess he'll think I can lick
Ev'ry other feller's father
Well, I can!
I bet that he'll turn out to be
The spittin' image of his dad
But he'll have more common sense
Than his puddin-headed father ever had
I'll teach him to wrassle
And dive through a wave
When we go in the mornin's for our swim
His mother can teach him
The way to behave
But she won't make a sissy out o' him
Not him! Not my boy! Not Bill!
Bill. I will see that he is named after me, I will
My boy, Bill! He'll be tall
And tough as a tree, will Bill!
Like a tree he'll grow
With his head held high
And his feet planted firm on the ground
And you won't see nobody dare to try
To boss or toss him around!
No pot-bellied, baggy-eyed bully'll toss him around
I don't give a damn what he does
As long as he does what he likes!
He can sit on his tail
Or work on a rail
With a hammer, hammering spikes!
He can ferry a boat on a river
Or peddle a pack on his back
Or work up and down
The streets of a town
With a whip and a horse and a hack
He can haul a scow along a canal
Run a cow around a corral
Or maybe bark for a carousel
Of course it takes talent to do that well
He might be a champ of theheavyweights
Or a feller that sells you glue
Or President of the United States
That'd be all right, too
His mother would like that
But he wouldn't be President unless he wanted to be
Not Bill!
My boy, Bill! He'll be tall
And as tough as a tree, will Bill
Like a tree he'll grow
With his head held high
And his feet planted firm on the ground
And you won't see nobody dare to try
To boss or toss him around!
No fat-bottomed, flabby-faced, pot-bellied, baggy-eyed bastard'll boss
Him around
And I'll be damned if he'll marry the boss' daughter
A skinny-lipped virgin with blood like water
Who'll give him a peck
And call it a kiss
And look in his eyes through a lorgnet

And startin' to go with a girl

Could it be?
What the hell!
What if he is a girl?
What would I do with her?
What could I do for her?

But you got to be a father to a girl

Little tin-type of her mother!
What a pair!

Pink and white
As peaches and cream is she
My little girl
Is half again as bright
As girls are meant to be!
Dozens of boys pursue her
Many a likely lad does what he can to woo her
From her faithful dad
She has a few
Pink and white young fellers of two and three
But my little girl
Gets hungry ev'ry night and she come home to me!
My little girl, my little girl!
I got to get ready before she comes!
I got to make certain that she
Won't be dragged up in slums
With a lot o' bums like me
She's got to be sheltered
And be dressed in the best money can buy!

And soft summer nights
We'd hide from the lights
On the village green

With all that perfumed hair
And it came undone

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in they dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight
For christ is born of mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth
How silently, how silently, the wondrous gift is given
So God imparts to human hearts the blessings of his heaven
No ear may hear his coming, but in this world of sin
Where meek souls will receive him still, the dear christ enters in

"No one ever tells you what it's like to love and lose
How it feels to waken and have breakfast with the blues
How to go on living, how to face another day
No one ever tells you the way
No one ever tells you how it feels to walk alone
Listening for those footsteps through the echo of your own
Suddenly it hits you all those dreams weren't worth a dime
'Cause no one ever tells you in time
Long before the icy winds of winter
Autumn tells the swallows, time to fly
Why did she pretend till the bitter end
Till it broke my heart to say goodbye
No one ever tells you that it's just another fling
No one ever warns you when your heart begins to sing
Someone tells you later all is fair in love and war
But no one ever tells you before
No one ever tells you that it's just another fling
No one ever warns you when your heart begins to sting
Someone tells you later all is fair in love and war
But no one ever tells you before
It never comes easy, no one ever tells you before",,,On one ever tells you by Frank Sinatra,False,https://images.genius.com/5f746dbf6c41747811e11452bfabb552.300x300x1.jpg,https://images.genius.com/5f746dbf6c41747811e11452bfabb552.490x490x1.jpg,complete,https://images.genius.com/5f746dbf6c41747811e11452bfabb552.300x300x1.jpg,https://images.genius.com/5f746dbf6c41747811e11452bfabb552.490x490x1.jpg,On one ever tells you,On one ever tells you,[],Frank Sinatra,824
"Hey, drink up all you people
And order anything you see
Have fun you happy people
The drink and the laughs on me
Try to think that love's not around
Still it's uncomfortably near
My old heart ain't gaining any ground
Because my angel eyes ain't here
Angel eyes, that old devil sent
They glow unbearably bright
Need I say that my love's mispent
Mispent with angel eyes tonight
So drink up all of you people
Order anything you see
And have fun you happy people
The drink and the laughs on me
Pardon me but I gotta run
The fact's uncommonly clear
I gotta find who's now the number one
And why my angel eyes ain't here
Excuse me while I disappear",,,Angel eyes - live at golden nugget/1987/edit by Frank Sinatra,False,https://images.genius.com/5f746dbf6c41747811e11452bfabb552.300x300x1.jpg,https://images.genius.com/5f746dbf6c41747811e11452bfabb552.490x490x1.jpg,complete,https://images.genius.com/5f746dbf6c41747811e11452bfabb552.300x300x1.jpg,https://images.genius.com/5f746dbf6c41747811e11452bfabb552.490x490x1.jpg,Angel eyes - live at golden nugget/1987/edit,Angel eyes - live at golden nugget/1987/edit,[],Frank Sinatra,824

"Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two
Can be made like new
On the street of dreams
Gold, silver and gold
All you can hold's up there on a moonbeam
For there ain't nobody poor, long as love is sure

"I heard the bells on Christmas day
Their old familiar carols play
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Of peace on earth, good will to men
I thought how, as the day had come
The belfries of all Christendom
Had rolled along th' unbroken song
Of peace on earth, good will to men
And in despair I bowed my head
""There is no peace on earth,"" I said
""For hate is strong and mocks the song
Of peace on earth, good will to men.""
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep:
