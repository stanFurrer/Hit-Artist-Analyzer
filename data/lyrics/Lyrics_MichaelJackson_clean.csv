I said, ""Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?""
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor, in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts"" (Hee-eeh)
And mother always told me, ""Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (Oh-oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth"" (Oh-oh)

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son, hoo!
She says I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee, no-no-no, hee-hee-hee)
Hoo!

For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand?
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, hee!
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (Ah-hoo!)
She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby crying, his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
(Ooh, hee-hee-hee)

People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts""
(Don't break no hearts!) (Hee-hee)
She came and stood right by me
Then the smell of sweet perfume (Ha-oh)
This happened much too soon (Ha-oh, ha-ooh)
She called me to her room (Ha-oh, hoo!)

Billie Jean is not my lover (Hoo!)
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
No-no-no, no-no-no-no-no-no

And the world we once believed in will shine again in grace

Would this Earth crucify its soul?

This world is heavenly
Be God's glow

We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die

Create a world with no fear
Together, we'll cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into
Ploughshares

Take my hand, I'll take you there

Take me to a place without no name

As she took me right through the fog
I saw a beautiful city appear
Where kids are playing and people are laughing and smiling and nothing to fear
She says this is the place where no people have pain, with love and happiness

I've seen the grass, and the skies and the birds, and the flowers, surrounded by the trees
This place is filled with love and happiness, how in the world, could I wanna leave

It’s the day, a brand new day, let’s both go outside and play
Let us walk down the park, making love ‘til it’s dark
Let me move, let me soothe, ‘til the break of dawn and you know it’s true, oh

The girl with the tune
Who sings in the daytime at noon
She was there screaming
Beating her voice in her doom
But nobody came to her soon

A fall down the stairs
Her dress torn
Oh the blood in her hair
A mystery so sullen in air
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
Oh the blood in her hair

Everyone came to see
The girl that now is dead
So blind stare the eyes in her head
And suddenly a voice from the crowd said
This girl lived in vain
Her face bear such agony, such strain

But only the man from next door
Knew Little Susie and how he cried
As he reached down
To close Susie's eyes
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
Oh the blood in her hair

It was all for God's sake
For her singing the tune
For someone to feel her despair
To be damned to know hoping is dead and you're doomed
Then to scream out
And nobody's there
She knew no one cared
Father left home, poor mother died
Leaving Susie alone
Grandfather's soul too had flown
No one to care
Just to love her
How much can one bear
Rejecting the needs in her prayers

Neglection can kill
Like a knife in your soul
Oh it will
Little Susie fought so hard to live
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care

Half of me you’ll never be, so you should feel threatened by me

The unknown monster is about to embark
From a far corner, out of the dark
A nightmare, that’s the case
Never Neverland, that’s the place
This particular monster can read minds
Be in two places at the same time
This is judgment night, execution, slaughter
The devil, ghosts, this monster is torture
You can be sure of one thing, that’s fate
A human presence that you feel is strange
A monster that you can see disappear
A monster, the worst thing to fear

You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
While you sleep, while you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you’ll never be, so you should feel threatened by me

Someone is hiding the truth, hold on

And will the sun ever shine
In the blind man's eyes when he cries?

You can touch the sky (gonna to take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm going to need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight

People laugh when they're feeling sad
Someone is taking a life, hold on
Respect to believe in your dreams
Tell me where were you
When your children cried last night?

Faces fill with madness
Miracles unheard of, hold on
Faith is found in the winds
All we have to do
Is to reach for the truth, the truth

From one more violent crime

Why her father had to die
She asked the men in blue

Who will live and who will die
Did God say that you could decide?
You saw he did not run
And that my daddy had no gun

In the middle of a village
Way in a distant land
Lies a poor boy with his broken toy
Too young to understand

He is awaken, ground is shaking
His father grabs his hand
Screaming, crying, his wife is dying
Now he is left to explain

Why his mother had to die
What did these soldiers come here for?
If they are for peace, why is there war?

Did God say that they could decide
Who will live and who will die?

Was try to take care of her kids

Watching people lose their lives
It seems as if we have no voice
It is time for us to make a choice

Who will live and who will die
There is nothing that cannot be done

To terrorize your neighborhood
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell

The demons squeal in sheer delight

For though the groove is hard to beat
Yet still you stand with frozen feet
You try to run, you try to scream
But no more sun you'll ever see
For evil reaches from the crypt
To crush you in its icy grip

The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of 40,000 years
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist

But who knows just what the future brings
And wouldn't you like to go with me?
And she answered ""No"" to me but

Take away this never ending sorrow
Take this lonely feeling from my soul
If only I knew what things bring tomorrow
She'd be sitting here beside me
And my heart would then be whole

I hope to make a change now for the better
Never letting fate control my soul
And I'm hoping that my prayers will see

Cuts through the air

And shivers in fright
She hides from the color
That rides on the night
The light through the window
That lights up the sky
And causes her mournful cry
Scared of the moon

Don't be bothered they said
It's just childish fantasies turning your head
No need to worry
It's really too soon
But there she lies shivering

And soon childhood ends
But life is still fearful
When evening descends
The fear of a child
Still intrudes the night
Returning on beams of light
Scared of the moon
The feeling of terror
She felt as a youth
Has turned from a fantasy
Into the truth
The moon is the enemy
Twisting her soul
And taking its fearful toll
Scared of the moon
But now there are others who sit in a room
And wait for the sunlight to brighten their gloom
Together they gather
Their lunacy shade
But knowing just why they're scared

Should go by the plan

One family of love

As God cries above
And the giving, not the taking
With hearts open wide
And it looks like we fall
And it burns like a flame

So what is my life
If I do not believe
There is someone to watch me
Follow my dreams
Take all my chances, like those who dare
And what of our world
What does it become
When the damage is done
And you held out, you said no, you stand up

Only God knows
That it is all in the game
It is all in your name
Carry me to the gates of paradise

An angel of peace
To love and protect us
Through all of our tears

There is someone to watch me

Take all my chances, like those who dare
And where is the peace
We are searching for
Under the shadows of war
Can we hold out, and stand up, and say no

Will they all know

Then we will all know

Were turbulent tempests in my own form

Of every encounter, of passion, of heat

Have thrilled my senses beyond all haste

I didn't know what to do, so I stopped, then got out, and looked down, I noticed I've got a flat
So I walked out, parked the car, like sideways
So I can find, what I can fix
I looked around, there were no cars on the highway
I felt a strange feeling, like a mist
So I walked down, toward the end of the road
And in the fog, a woman appeared
She said don't you worry my friend, I'll take care
Take my hand, I'll take you there

Take me to a place without no name

Take me to a place without no name

As she took me right through the fog
I saw a beautiful city appear
Where kids are playing and people are laughing and smiling and nothing to fear
She says this is the place where no people have pain, with love and happiness
She turned around, looked down in my eyes, and started crying, and grabbed my hand, you've got a friend

Take me to a place without no name

Take me to a place without no name

Take me to a place without no name

Take me to a place without no name

She started liking me, kissing me, and hugging me
She didn't really, really want me to leave
She showed me places I've never seen, and things I've never done, it really looked like a lot of fun
I've seen the grass, and the skies and the birds, and the flowers, surrounded by the trees
This place is filled with love and happiness, how in the world, could I wanna leave
So then I went in my pocket, took my wallet all out
With my pictures of my family and girl
This is the place that you choose to be with me

Throw away my time

(Piano intro)

I have seen the Book of Tales
Crafted by magical hands
Older than time itself
Its pages are filled with darkness
And mystery

There's a ghost down in the hall
There's a ghoul beneath the bed
Now it's coming through the walls
Now it's climbing up the stairs
There's a spirit in the dark
Hear the beating of his heart
Can you feel it in the air
'Cause they're hiding everywhere
(Aaaahhh!)

Is that scary for you, baby
Am I scary for you, boy
Is this scary for you, baby
Is this scary for you
You know the stranger is you
Is this scary for you, baby
(Whispering and breathing)
{Sorcery...Illusions...}

There's a creaking on the floor
There's a creep behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody's sitting there
There's a ghastly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin nearly open
Where a restless soul is pokin'
I am gonna be
Exactly what you gonna see
So did you come to me
To see your fantasies
Perform before your very eyes
A haunting ghostly treat
The ghoulish trickery
And spirits dancing in the night
But if you came to see
The truth, the purity
It's here inside a lonely heart
So let the performance start
I always feel like
Somebody's watchin' me
I always feel like
Somebody's watchin' me

Threatened
All hail, the king has risen
You're by yourself, but it's my touch you felt
I'm not a ghost from Hell, but I've got a spell on you
You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
Why you sleep, why you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me
You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
Why you sleep, why you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me

What you have just witnessed could be the end of a particularly terrifying nightmare
It isn't - it's the beginning

Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do cause the lie becomes the truth

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand?
Her schemes and plans
Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (hoo)
She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby crying, his eyes were like mine (oh no)
Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby

People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Then the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son

And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination

You hear a creature creeping up behind

The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood

Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell

Mini Review of Griots Lament by Akello Stone
""These days we are bombarded with lots of visual media, stories and messages in the forms of videos. Most of it is completely unimaginative but Griot's Lament is much different It truly is a short-form ""theatrical experience on the small screen"" that evokes thoughts with the kind of intellectual depth, auditory stimulation and cadence, and visual creativity that many of us so desire. It truly captures the wonder, the suspense, the social commentary that can draw you in and leave you sitting - wanting more."" Bravo!

Trayvon Martin Revisited Via Michael Jackson’s Lyrics in “Griot’s Lament”
JULY 16, 2014 • ENTERTAINMENT, FEATURED • VIEWS: 221
There’s a new trend in entertainment, repurposing the lyrics of artists like Tupac (Holler If Ya’ Hear Me on Broadway) and now, a new web series, Griot’s Lament does the same with the King of Pop’s lyrics.  It is excellently done and one of the most innovative web series that I’ve seen in a long time and it comes from director, Aleks Munoz.
Here is what the Director had to say about his latest effort, “My next film “GRIOT”S LAMENT” applies Michael Jackson’s lyrics to the artists’ ongoing exploration of metamorphosis as a threshold of change, and as medium for identifying political and social injustices .”
An innocent black man was killed, and we are that injustice” sang Michael alongside his sister Janet in the song SCREAM. I use “recontexualization” of these lyrics to revisit the killings of Trayvon Martin, Oscar Grant, and the countless number of innocent youths that have fallen prey to violence in Southwest Chicago.

“They don’t care about us” was shouted as a veiled response to the Rodney King beating , but could it have also been a foretelling or foreshadowing of the tragic humanitarian failures incurred during Hurricane Katrina? One violent scene in the film is staged to replicate the horrific Rodney King beating. The film asks the question, as Michael did repeatedly via his music: How culpable are WE… when society cannot fully function in the realm of justice?

The character “Griot” is the conduit for Michael’s often overlooked and under recognized political orientation, a perspective that is often over shadowed by the glow and power of his popular music and larger than life persona.  I began writing Griot’s Lament the night that Michael left us. In my heart , it is my sincere hope that Griot’s Lament is a fitting tribute to the King of Pop, whose music is the soundtrack to much of my life.”
The film uses formerly incarcerated youth, as both talent and crew  from Munoz’s FYI FILMS by Youth Inside, which empowers incarcerated youth via story telling and digital film making.

Euphoria
That is the new word for today
Euphoria
It is very easy to say
Say Euphoria and you will feel fine from the start
You can close your eyes
And see the world with your heart
Do what you wish, be what you are
What a victorious thrill
Wearing a smile, all of the while
Feeling the world standing still
Watch rainbows glow rest on a bed of flowers
Then dial a star
Anything is in your powers

Euphoria
Full euphoria
Knowing no ills, needing no pills
Singing a rock and roll hymn
Feeling glorious, full of love
Fine from the start
You can close your eyes
And see the world with your heart
How good to be happy and free
Living the way that you choose
Healthy and clean
Cannot understand anyone having the blues
Euphoria never to feel frustration
How great to give love without invitation

Mother runs to the table and the note she read
Father runs to the table he said what’s going on?
Mother cries desperately, our little baby is gone
(Chorus)
Do you know where your children are?
Because it’s not 12 o’clock, and they’re somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it’s not 12 o’clock, and they’re somewhere out on the street

She wrote that she's tired of step-daddy using her
Saying that he'll buy her things while sexually abusing her
Just think that she’s all alone somewhere out on the street
How will this girl survive she ain’t got nothing to eat
(Chorus)
Do you know where your children are?
Because it’s not 12 o’clock, and they’re somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
(Verse 3: Jay-Z)
Maintaining this is the same old thang
Little stress, little fault, too much change
I see you kept it moving, you see I kept improving
See now we have an agreement, remember how I used to walk up and down the street man
Put it down to the streets watching saying hood it down
Just to earn nothing what good is it now
(Chorus)
Do you know where your children are?
Because it’s not 12 o’clock, and they’re somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it’s not 12 o’clock, and they’re somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Save me from this living hell
Save me cause that I'm gonna do
Save me I'm tired and I'm fed
Save me cause this because of you
Save me cause I’m on a debt
Save me cause I don't want no more
Save me cause terror arrived
Save me

Now she’s on the move, she’s off to Hollywood
She says she wanna be a star, she heard the money is good
She gets off from the train station, a man is waiting there
I’ll show you what the money is, girl just let down your hair
He’s taking her on the streets of sunset boulevard
She’s selling her body ha girl that will take ya far
The police comes around the corner somebody up there told
He’s arresting this little girl she’s only 12 years old
Do you know where your children are?
Because it’s not 12 o’clock, and they’re somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it’s not 12 o’clock, and they’re somewhere out on the street

To terrorize y'all's neighborhood

And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell

The funk of 40 thousand years

And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller!

Against the thing with 40 eyes, girl

Are a result of the fact that children have had their childhood stolen from them
The magic, the wonder, the mystery, and the innocence of a child's heart
Are the seeds of creativity that will heal the world

Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for the world that I come from
'Cause I've been looking around
In the lost and found of my heart
No one understands me
They view it as such strange eccentricities
'Cause I keep kidding around
Like a child, but pardon me

People say I'm not okay
'Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the Childhood I've never known
Have you seen my Childhood?

When I create my music, I feel like an instrument of nature
I wonder what delight nature must feel when we open our hearts and express our God-given talents
What we need to learn from children isn't childish
They know the way to summon things that lie waiting to be recognized within our own hearts

People say I'm strange that way
'Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the Childhood (Childhood) I've never known

Have you seen my Childhood?

There's something i have to say to you
If you promise you'll understand
I cannot contain myself when in your presence
I'm so humble, touch me
Don't hide our love, woman to man
Verse 1
She's just a lover who's doin' me by
Is it worth a giving, is it worth the try
You cannot cleave it, put it in the furnace
I do not wet it, you cannot burn it
Hook
She wants to give
(She wants to give it all, she wants to give it)
Dare me
(She wants to give it all, she wants to give it)
She wants to give it
(She wants to give it all, she wants to give it)
(She wants to give it all, she wants to give it)
Verse 2
It's just a feeling, you have to soothe it
You can't neglect it, you can't abuse it
It's just desire, you cannot waste it
Then if you want it then why don't you taste it
Hook
She wants to give
(She wants to give it all, she wants to give it)
Dare me
(She wants to give it all, she wants to give it)
She's gonna get it
(She wants to give it all, she wants to give it)
(She wants to give it all, she wants to give it)
Interlude
One thing in life you must understand
The truth of lust, woman to man
So open the door and you will see
There are no secrets to make you move, set me free
Chorus
Because something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you baby
Interlude
Just promise me, whatever we say
Or whatever we do to each other
For now we'll make a vow
To just keep it in the closet
Verse 3
If you can get it, it's worth a try
I really want it, i can't deny
It's just desire, i really love it
(Cuz if it's aching, you have to rub it)
Hook
She wants to give
(She wants to give it all, she wants to give it)
Dare me
(She wants to give it all, she wants to give it)
She's gonna get it
(She wants to give it all, she wants to give it)
(She wants to give it all, she wants to give it)
Interlude
Just open the door and you will see
This passion burns inside of me
Don't say to me you never tell
Touch me there, make the move, cast the spell
Chorus
Because something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you baby
That makes me want
Interlude
Just promise me
Whatever we say or do to each other
For now, we'll make a vow
To just keep it in the closet
Chorus
Because there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
Because there's something about you baby

Cuts through the air
And pins the child lying there

And shivers in fright
She hides from the color
That rides on the night
The light through the window
That lights up the sky
And causes her mournful cry
Scared of the moon
There's nothing wrong
Don't be bothered they said
It's just childish fantasies turning your head
No need to worry
It's really too soon
But there she lies shivering

And soon childhood ends
But life is still fearful
When evening descends
The fear of a child
Still intrudes the night
Returning on beams of light
Scared of the moon
The feeling of terror
She felt as a youth
Has turned from a fantasy
Into the truth
The moon is the enemy
Twisting her soul
And taking its fearful toll
Scared of the moon
But now there are others who sit in a room
And wait for the sunlight to brighten their gloom
Together they gather
Their lunacy shade
But knowing just why they're scared

Born as Jeffrey Santana, he has not only entered the apex of the worldwide DJ scene, but has also pursued various prosperous producing and entrepreneurial endeavors as well. The DJ knew early on in his life that he was determined to turn his passion for music into a full blown career and lifestyle, and did exactly that with both elegance and class. Regarded as a highly sought after DJ, Fabrejay has a long list of famous clients, which includes the likes of Rihanna, Diddy, Former President Barack Obama, and celebrity couple Beyonce and Jay-Z. Fabrejay performs on a regular basis at some of the hottest venues and events around the world. Currently, the DJ holds the honorable position of brand ambassador for the alcohol company D’usse Cognac, in addition to holding a residency as well as being the official DJ of Jay-Z’s exclusive celebrity hot spot nightclub, The 40/40 Club, located in New York City, NY. 
Fabrejay’s story is a modern reflection of the vast and ever-evading American Dream, and he emphasizes in his music and speech the need for every individual to chase the success they feel they deserve and should have. The talented DJ has worked with some of the best in not only the hip hop world, but also in the music industry as a whole. There doesn't seem to be anything stopping this talented individual from ascending the ladder into greatness, and perhaps one day joining the likes of his celebrated clients and musical heroes. 
However, being an accomplished artist does not just begin and end with the individuals themselves. Musical influences also play a major role in what direction the artist chooses to pursue, and what roads he will take. Without having those key voices surrounding you growing up, one would not be turned on to the type of things that could be done in the future of the industry. Fabrejay has a variety of different influences that he has stated helped him get to the level where he is now. Growing up, Fabrejay had found inspiration through a number of different genres of music. The main ones which caught the attention of the DJ at an early age included Latin, Oldies, Top 40, and Hip-Hop. However, Fabrejay has found that three main artists had the most influence on him, and opened his eyes to possibilities he had not seen before. They represent a soundtrack for various stages in his life, and have been more influential to him during his early days than any other artist, each marking a special era in his life. 
Here we have listed the top 3 musical influences of the Fabrejay. Perhaps one day, they could guide the next generation on their journey as well. 
Michael Jackson 
Michael Jackson gained enormous popularity throughout his life as an acclaimed singer, dancer, and songACwriter. Starting off as a member of a sibling singing group known as “The Jackson Five,” personal talent, drive, and a motivating family influenced the young singer to branch off and make his own way as a solo performing artist. Michael Jackson soon began releasing his own music. This led to hit album after hit album, which contained such recognizable and world famous musical hits like “Beat It,” “Billie Jean,” “Man in the Mirror,” and “Thriller.” Jackson was even one of the first to create a cinematic music video experience for his audiences, which featured storylines and a variety of famous people involved in the overall process. Some of these celebrities included Martin Scorsese, Paul McCartney, Chris Tucker, Macaulay Culkin, and John Travolta. Michael Jackson eventually became known as one of the greatest entertainers in the entire music history, and went on to earn some of the highest accolades in the industry. Dubbed simply as the “King of Pop,” he was acknowledged as one of the best selling artists 
of all time. Though Jackson passed away in 2009 at the early age of 50, he is still known around the world for his music which emphasized togetherness, environmentalism, and fighting against the prejudices and injustices of the world. 
Fabrejay, like many other people at the height of Michael Jackon's music, has stated that the singer and songwriter was his introduction to music. His dance moves had caught the world by storm, and influenced the young Fabrejay growing up, shaping the young man's mind to a significant degree about the possibilities that remained in the music industry. The DJ states that the infamous “Smooth Criminal” song, as well as it's accompanying music video, was one of his favorites of all time. Through “Smooth Criminal,” Jackson was also able to contribute to Fabrejay's own fashion sense and clothing options. As a fan of sneakers, Fabrejay to this day considers the Air Jordan 11 Concord to be his favorite among all of the other Jordan sneakers currently on the market. This is because they gave the DJ vivid memories of Michael Jackson's anti-gravity shoes containing spats, which Jackson had used in his “leaning” dance moves in the music video for “Smooth Criminal.” 
In regards to his admiration for the acclaimed singer and songwriter Michael Jackson, Fabrejay says, “He was so creative and his music is timeless, he reached unthinkable heights. There’s really so much inspiration when it comes to MJ.” 
Like many up and coming artists, as well as established celebrities in the music industry, Michael Jackson remains a favorite. 
Tupac Shakur 
Tupac Shakur, who was also known by his stage name 2Pac, was an American rapper and actor. Tupac was born in New York City and later moved to Baltimore Maryland and then Marin City, California. This constant moving played deep in his music. The rapper became a central figure in rap, eventually releasing the critically acclaimed and successful albums “2Pacalypse Now,” “Me Against the World,” and “All Eyez on Me.” He solidified himself in the rap scene, with many of his songs reflecting the “thug” lifestyle. Many people still consider Tupac Shakur as one of the greatest rappers in the history of music, proven by the amount of famous collaborations with the rapper both before and after his death in 1996. 2Pac’s songs were highly thought provoking and deep, touching on the struggles and social issues that faced much of the lower classes, as well as the overall inequality between people in general. The rapper remains one of the best selling artists of all time, and has also appeared in a variety of noteworthy movies, such as “Juice,” “Poetic Justice,” and “Gridlock’d.” His acting was praised by movie critics as well as his fellow cast members. 
Fabrejay has stated that Tupac was an artist that highly influenced him throughout the progression of his own musical career. He admired Tupac's ability to possess so much raw energy, and to release that energy into his songs and music. He became captivated not only by the music being made, but also Tupac's persona and what he stood for as a human being. For Fabrejay, Tupac’s songs and the accompanying 
lyrics had a strong and bold message written between every word and behind every beat, which forced the world to listen to the music through strength and grit. 
In speaking about Tupac, the DJ has said, “He’s a timeless artist. You feel as if he’s still around because the stuff he’s talking about is still relevant to date.” 
And the number of accolades the artist has received, and his popularity among people still hold that as a valid truth, hopefully for many, many years to come. 
Jay Z 
When one thinks of the music industry as a whole, the name Jay-Z is impossible to escape. Jay Z is a renowned rapper, songwriter, entrepreneur, and record executive. Born in New York City and hailing from Brooklyn, the musical artist started rapping at a young age. But it wasn't until he founded his own record label, Roc-A-Fella Records, in 1995 that he started to gain notoriety from the masses. He is one of the first rappers to utilize his business acumen in addition to his rapping skills to become successful. Jay-Z began with the release of his studio album “Reasonable Doubt” in 1996, and he instantly gained celebrity status, eventually going on to drop hit after hit through his key albums “The Blueprint” and “The Black Album.” The artist even released two albums, “Watch the Throne” and “Everything is Love,” with fellow rapper Kanye West and his wife Beyonce, respectively. Aside from music, the rapper had gone on to have a very successful business career, by founding his own clothing retailer, opening a sports bar, creating an entertainment company, as well as engaging in other lucrative ventures. These business choices all led Jay-Z to become the the first billionaire of the hip hop industry, and he is currently also the wealthiest musician on the planet. However, his backbone is his music, with the world considering him one of the world's best-selling music artists. He has acquired a large number of awards throughout the years, including Grammys and Billboards. He was also acknowledged in the Rolling Stones magazine as one of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. 
Fabrejay has very fond memories of the rapper Jay-Z being the backbone of his youth. He has stated that Jay-Z has been the “it” artist from his younger days until now, and has provided the soundtrack musically from his early years to date. Fabrejay also admires the fact that Jay-Z was able to remain at the top of the charts throughout his career, something that other artists find is more difficult to achieve. He sees Jay-Z as one of the most important symbols in the music industry. There is also an admiration for his personality and the vibe he brings to the world, not just the crowds he performs to. His business acumen is another thing that Fabrejay regards as something he looks upto about the artist, utilizing his teachings to learn what can and cannot be done in the path of pursuing success. As a DJ in the music industry who has made a name for himself as well, it would only make sense that he follows one of the prime examples of success In an industry that topples many other weaker artists. 
This is what the DJ had to say about Jay-Z: “He’s broken and continues to break barriers. Just the length of his career shelf life serves as inspiration in itself. He's remained true to himself throughout it all and continues to elevate gracefully. Jay's a genius. I'm blessed to work under the umbrella of my hero.” 
Jay-Z is definitely a strong person worth admiring at an early age, and you could guarantee it shaped Fabrejay to become the success he is now. 
As you can see, an artist's greatness is only as strong as the influences he had growing up. It's how the individual shapes those traits and ideas he learns that makes him unique and successful in his own right. Fabrejay's influences vary in style. Michael Jackson has a more mainstream and pop oriented feel. Tupac speaks more about social issues and preaches how to rise from poverty. Jay-Z pushes the envelope in music, talking more about mainstream struggles and pop culture phenomenon. Regardless of these differences, it's clear that a combination of worthy admiration was necessary for Fabrejay in creating his own interpretation of greatness. The acclaimed DJ has a style all his own, and it reflects these influences as well as a variety of others. Fabrejay is continually building himself, and only time will tell what the artists can and will achieve.

I've done all to be done
To always do my best
By listening to me, myself
So he can do or else
(Of without compromise
Shall follow the feel of constant care)
In my eleven hour
I'll be a man the way
To face whatever falls my way
Prepared that are a shame
To just be called a part of God
For which I have been named
A man and a woman's youngest son
While growing, still a child
And that will make my father proud
And make my mother smile...
